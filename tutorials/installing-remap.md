# Installing Remap

To get started, follow these steps:

## Written Instructions:

1. Download and install Unity Hub by visiting this link: [https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe) Note: Unity Hub is a tool that allows you to manage different Unity versions and projects in one place.
2. Once Unity Hub is installed, open it and navigate to the "Installs" tab. Here, you will want to download Unity version 2021.3.10f.1 or above by clicking the "Add" button and selecting the appropriate version.
3. Once you have downloaded Unity, return to the Unity Hub home screen and click on "New Project" to create a new project. Ensure that you select "3D" as the template, choose a project name, and set the project location. Then, click "Create Project."
4. Next, download the map editor zip from the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/AyeZeeBB/R5R-Unity-Map-Editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip](https://github.com/AyeZeeBB/R5R-Unity-Map-Editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) Note: The file is approximately 1GB in size, so it may take a while to download depending on your internet connection.
5. After the download is complete, return to Unity Hub and click on the three dots next to your project. Then, select "Show in Explorer" to open the project folder in Windows Explorer.
6. Within the project folder, navigate to the "Assets" folder. This is where you will need to drag all of the files from the previously downloaded Remap zip file. To do so, extract the files from the zip file and then drag them into the Assets folder.
7. Once the files are in the Assets folder, you can either open your project or return to Unity and open the project from the Unity Hub home screen. Remap files should automatically import and be ready for use in your project.

That's it! You should now be ready to use Remap. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
